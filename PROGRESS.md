## 🎯 Key Achievements

### **1. Accurate Custody Parsing** ✅
- Parses 170 custody events from 2025 calendar
- Correctly identifies "Brian" titled events (including variants like "Brian/Thanksgiving")
- Implements "golden rule": whoever child wakes up with gives the pill
- Handles 2-2-5 pattern with alternating weekends
- Verified: November shows 16 father days, 15 mother days

### **2. Correct Distribution Logic** ✅
- Distribution date = day BEFORE mother's next pill day
- Accounts for custody pickup timing (evening before)
- Example: Mom needs pill Saturday morning → Give pills Friday evening

### **3. Database Seeded with Real Data** ✅
- Oct 8, 2025 fill: 30 pills, Publix #1250, Rx #15013721
- Oct 13, 2025 distribution: 16 pills to mom
- Mom runs out Oct 29
- Next refill Nov 2

### **4. Configuration Complete** ✅
- `.env` file with Kid's Schedule calendar ID
- Google Calendar authentication working
- Database path configured

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Session

### Bug #1: Only Finding 2 Custody Blocks
**Problem:** Exact string match `== "Brian"` missed "Brian/Thanksgiving"  
**Solution:** Changed to substring match `"Brian" in title`  
**Result:** Now finds all variants (Brian, Brian/Thanksgiving, Brian - Bday, etc.)

### Bug #2: Wrong Distribution Date
**Problem:** Showing today's date instead of actual custody pickup  
**Solution:** Fixed logic to find next mother custody day AFTER she runs out, then subtract 1 day  
**Result:** Correctly shows Oct 31 (Friday pickup) for Nov 1 pill day

### Bug #3: Incorrect Pill Count (7 vs 16)
**Problem:** Missing holiday events caused undercounting father's days  
**Solution:** Fixed substring matching to catch all Brian variants  
**Result:** Accurate 16/15 split for November

## 💡 Technical Insights Learned

### Custody Schedule Complexity:
- **Two types of "days":**
  - **Pill day** = Morning custody (who gives pill)
  - **Custody day** = Pickup/handoff (usually 5pm)
- Distribution happens at custody pickup (evening before pill day)

### Calendar Event Patterns:
- "Brian" = regular custody
- "Brian/[Event]" = custody with special occasion
- Holiday events (F(E)/M(O)) are informational only
- Trust "Brian" titled events as source of truth

### Golden Rule Implementation:
- Parse custody blocks: Start @ 5pm → End @ 5pm
- Pill days: Mornings of (Start + 1 day) through (End day)
- Mother gets all remaining days not in father's blocks
